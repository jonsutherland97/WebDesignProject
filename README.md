## **Problem Statement** ##
Our goal is to protect the wildlife of the rainforests (current events, wildfires in Brazil). The problems in the rainforests consist of wildfires, poison from oil and chemical spills, hydroelectric projects, erosion from deforestation, degrading of water quality. Our organization will raise money to protect the animal’s habitats and protect endangered animals.

## Purpose of the Site

The purpose of our website is to bring awareness to the current events taking place in the rainforests, and raise money to help the affected wildlife. We are going to help the areas affected by wildfires by planting trees. We are also going to raise money to donate to wildlife rescue teams, to go to devastated areas and remove wildlife from life threatening situations. We will also raise money to donate to organizations currently protesting companies that are spilling oil, and creating inhabitable rainforests. Our main goal is to raise enough funds to purchase a substantial amount of the world’s rainforests and create wildlife preserves. 
     
## **Site Audience** ##

With our site we want to target people who care about the environment and wildlife. Generally, this would be more millennials and generation z, as these generations are concerned with environmental impact. We also want to target middle to upper class people, so they will be more willing to make a monetary donation to our organization.

## **Competitor Analysis** ##
## World Wildlife Fund
Strengths: On the homepage of the World Wildlife Fund, the point of interest is a black and white picture that features a silhouette of a man. They are very specific about what they do, and it is very easy to access all the information. On the top of the homepage, the navigation consists of our work, species, and places. So this makes it very easy to see what the organization does. The mission statement is right on the homepage when you go to the website, so you know right away what this organization stands for and what their mission is.

Weaknesses: Going through the website, we think that there is too much information on one page, and some of the pages look a little cluttered, such as the leadership page and the experts page. Also, even though it is quite easy to navigate throughout the site, there are still a lot of webpages only grouped under three sections on the navigation bar. So, perhaps there should have been more sections under the navigation to make each page more accessible and easy to get to.

## National Wildlife Federation
Strengths: The homepage has a good point of interest, the colors work well together, and the page is not overwhelmed with too much information. They also have their mission statement directly on the homepage, which is good for the audience to see right away what the organization stands for. 

Weaknesses: An ad to donate pops up right away when you go to the website, which is annoying especially if you are just going there to get some more information about the organization, rather than donate. The mission statement on the homepage is a nice idea, but we think that the organization could of made the mission statement more brief. 

## Wildlife Conservation Society
Strengths: The various pictures on the website are visually appealing, it is nice that they put pictures of the animals up on the website. Hamburger navigation is simple, and visually appealing. Hamburger navigation also makes the site very easy to navigate. 

Weaknesses: An ad to donate pops up right away when you go to the website, which is annoying especially if you are just going there to get some more information about the organization, rather than donate. The homepage has a lot of information and pictures on it, so it appears to be cluttered. The whole homepage is dedicated to donating to the organization, when we think it should be more focused on what the organization does. 

## Usability Testing

* Good homepage
* Typo on deforestation 
* Good layout
* Bird as favicon?
* Picture for shop section
* Each webpage is cohesive
* About us - who are we, fill in more space
* News page - wildlife trade fill in blank space
* Everyone thinks it’s great!
* Fix labels on shops!
* Brazil? Typo on pages
* Who we are - bring back mission statement, why are we doing this? Why do people want to support this?
* News page - past, current
* Fires in the rainforest - animals? Earth?
* Where is the money from the shop going? Proceeds go toward the cause
* Hover on the shop pictures
* Deforestation picture - change find a different picture



## Moving Forward

We will check our competitors websites in order to adapt to the wildlife preservation culture. We will update our website according to what our competition updates, trying to stay ahead of the game. We will make appropriate changes to our site that will increase the drive to our site.
