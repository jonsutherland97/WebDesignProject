## **Problem Statement** ##
Our goal is to protect the wildlife of the rainforests (current events, wildfires in Brazil). The problems in the rainforests consist of wildfires, poison from oil and chemical spills, hydroelectric projects, erosion from deforestation, degrading of water quality. Our organization will raise money to protect the animal’s habitats and protect endangered animals.

## Purpose of the Site

The purpose of our website is to bring awareness to the current events taking place in the rainforests, and raise money to help the affected wildlife. We are going to help the areas affected by wildfires by planting trees. We are also going to raise money to donate to wildlife rescue teams, to go to devastated areas and remove wildlife from life threatening situations. We will also raise money to donate to organizations currently protesting companies that are spilling oil, and creating inhabitable rainforests. Our main goal is to raise enough funds to purchase a substantial amount of the world’s rainforests and create wildlife preserves. 
     
## **Site Audience** ##

With our site we want to target people who care about the environment and wildlife. Generally, this would be more millennials and generation z, as these generations are concerned with environmental impact. We also want to target middle to upper class people, so they will be more willing to make a monetary donation to our organization.
